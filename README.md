# call-for-help
This is my project for the Hospital Of The Future hackathon
# What is this
This is a tool that can be used for kids in hospitals to call for help with the push of a button, or by saying "help". If the button is pressed, or "help" is said, the app will call the number set in the app.
# Instructions
 - Before use, make sure the number in the phone number field is correct. <b>Only put the numbers.</b> Example: 1234567890
- Say "help" or press the button to call for help.
- Tap call to confirm
- If you would like to use voice to confirm, do the following:
    - Open settings
    - Tap on "Accessibility"
    - Tap on "Voice Control"
    - Turn on "Voice Control"
- Now, to use voice to confirm the call, say "tap call"
